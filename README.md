# The Go Programming Language exercises

This is my attempt to complete some if not all of the exercises suggested in The Go [Programming Language book](https://www.gopl.io).

I am uploading this mostly to be able to run this wherever I need, e.g. when my DO droplet cannot allocate memory to run some of the examples :-).
